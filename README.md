## Key Features

- **Real-Time Scoring**
  - Powered by our custom **Forte Audio Engine** (Web Audio API), Encore actively listens to your microphone.
  - Features live pitch tracking, real-time key-modulation detection, and a visual piano roll overlay so you know exactly when to hit those high notes (only in Multiplex tracks).
- **Encore Link (Mobile Remote Control)**
  - No more passing a bulky songbook around! Just scan the QR code on the screen to connect your smartphone.
  - No additional app installs needed! Encore Link works straight in your web browser. (Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge) and Firefox)
  - Browse the song library, queue tracks, search YouTube, send "Cheers", and chat with the room.
  - Works seamlessly on your local network, with a Cloud tunnel fallback for devices not on the same network.
- **Versatile Media Support (MTVs & Multiplex)**
  - Supports MIDI karaoke (`.mid`, `.kar`) with SoundFont (`.sf2`) playback.
  - Supports RealSound tracks (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`) combined with `.lrc` lyrics.
  - Supports high-quality MTVs (Music Videos) (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.avi`).
  - Full support for **Multiplex tracks** (pan left/right to toggle the guide vocal).
- **Native YouTube Integration**
  - Don't have a song in your local library? Search YouTube directly from the player or your phone and queue it up instantly.
- **Instant Recording**
  - Record your best vocal performances directly to your hard drive with the press of a button.
- **Pitch & Latency Control**
  - Adjust pitch (transpose) and tempo on the fly.
  - Automatically calibrate your microphone and signal chain's latency quickly.
- **Japanese & Korean Romanization**
  - Love singing K-pop but can't read the language? What about your favorite anime openings? Encore automatically generates romanized lyrics for Japanese and Korean in real time.
  - Also supports Furigana (Ruby text) for MIDI karaoke files.
- **Discord Rich Presence**
  - Automatically shows what you're singing on your Discord status.

# Getting Started

## Library Setup

> [!WARNING]
> For legal reasons, Encore does not come with a Song Library by default. Learn more on how you can make your own libraries below, or contact us at [sky@encorekaraoke.org](mailto:sky@encorekaraoke.org).

Encore automatically scans your local drives for a folder named **`EncoreLibrary`**.

To build your library, structure your files like this:

```text
D:/EncoreLibrary/                                             # Also works on the C drive as well!
 ├── manifest.json                                            # Metadata and BGV (Background Video) configs
 ├── [Your Artist] - [Song].mp3                               # Audio file (Compatible with ID3 tags)
 ├── [Your Artist] - [Song].lrc                               # Matching LRC lyrics file
 ├── [Your Artist] - [Song].mp4                               # Video files for MTV
 └── [Your Artist] - [Song].mid or [Your Artist] - [Song].kar # MIDI files
```

_Note: For Multiplex tracks (where vocals are on one channel and instrumentals on the other), add `.multiplexed.` to the filename before the extension (e.g., `Song.multiplexed.mp3`)._

- Change your target `EncoreLibrary` path.
- Select the specific Microphone (Input) and Speaker (Output) hardware.
- Adjust Master Volume and Mic Latency overrides.
- Calibrate Video Sync offsets (for fixing A/V desync on older TVs).
- Change the Security PIN.
